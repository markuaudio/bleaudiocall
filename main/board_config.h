// P0 upwards, while the Bluetooth radio runs an inquiry so the ESP32 side draws
// about what it draws when streaming (verified: a test with the radio idle
// passed P4 while streaming at P4 still reset the board).
// The step in progress is written to NVS first; if the supply collapses and
// the IMP809 supervisor resets the board, the next boot knows which step did
// it and saves the previous one as the limit. No phone, no disconnect involved.
